# Bluetooth-Low-Energy-BLE-Project
Comprehensive implementation of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication using an STM32 microcontroller
This project showcases the implementation of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication on an STM32 microcontroller. It leverages BLE stacks to provide efficient and modular functionality for establishing wireless communication, focusing on GATT (Generic Attribute Profile), services, characteristics, and event handling.

Features
BLE Stack Integration: Utilizes a robust BLE stack for managing low-level communication and protocol handling.
GATT Profile: Structured implementation of data exchange using customizable services and characteristics.
Peripheral and Central Role Communication: Enables seamless device interaction in both roles.
Notifications and Event Handling: Efficient management of data updates through BLE notifications and interrupt-driven event handling.

Hardware
Microcontroller:NUCLEO-F411RE
BLE Module:X-NUCLEO-BNRG2A1
